# bluray_barcode_scanner
Scrapes the bluray.com website to find a movie name using UPC / EAN codes.

Most movies end up getting results from the bluray.com website, you can deploy the server and use a smartphone with a barcodescanner app as the client.

I will add more functionality as time moves along.
