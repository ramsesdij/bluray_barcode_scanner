# bluray_barcode_scanner
Scrapes the bluray.com website to find movies using UPC / EAN codes.

These movies can be used to fetch metadata from other API's.

Most movies end up getting results from the bluray.com website, you can deploy the server and use a smartphone with a barcodescanner app as the client.

The sole purpose of this application is to catalogue my own physical media without having to do this by hand.

I will add more functionality as time moves along.
